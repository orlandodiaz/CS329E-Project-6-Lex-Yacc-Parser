Problem 1
 support single boolean expression(integer) such as (if 0 1 2) returns 2 and with syntax erro check. 
 
 support arrays in calculation: (- 10 1 2 3 4) = 10-1-2-3-4 (/ 10 1 2 3 4) = 10/1/2/3/4

support complicated forms (let (a (let (b 5) (+ b 6))) (* 3 a)) = 33 

support both unary minus, (- 1) = -1, (- 2), and substraction(- 1 3) = -2

Will print the message when you let a variable twice , and keep the value original one
(let (a 4)(a 5)) returns 4 and will print erro message.
